I am using this as a learning experience to get more familiar with LUA scripts and the EdgeTX environment. 

# Rotorflight Flylog
Expanding on the excellent widget produced by Mo.

## Current changes include:
- The main widget screen now displays the complete total of flights and flight time, rather than only for the current session.

- The flight viewer now utilizes LibGUI widgets, allowing scrolling through past dates where flights are logged. It displays dates with logged flights, showing flight count and time for each selected date.
